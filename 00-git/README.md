# A collaborative exercise to learn Python and Git

## Objective

Build a city! The city will be printed out to the terminal (use python's `print()` function for this) and will have the following components:

- School
- Library
- Museum
- Fire Station
- Police Station
- Restaurant
- Park
- Lake
- Roads (vertical and horizontal)
- Hospital

Each team will be responsible for coding one component of the city. Each component is a member of a quarter. The quaters of the city are the following:

- Education
- Leisure
- Outdoors
- Safety

Once a team has coded their component they will open a Pull Request against this repository. Once all teams in a quarter have submitted their code, they will receive requirements for designing each quarter. **Beware** this may change the implementation of each component and cross team collaboration will be needed in order to support each other's implementation changes! Teams will then submit their code in the form of a Pull Request to this repository. We will then merge the PRs and print our city!

## Running the code

    $ python3 city.py

## Contributing Basics

To contribute to a repository on GitHub, you'll want to first [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) the repository. You can then [Clone](https://dont-be-afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/commandlinegit.html#clone-a-repository) that fork locally to start making changes. Make sure to [add a remote](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-remote) pointing to the repo you forked. Typically this remote is named `upstream`. To add changes to your fork you must [add](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line) and [commit](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line) them. You can then [Push](https://help.github.com/en/articles/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository) these changes to your fork on github and [create a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) against the forked repository.
